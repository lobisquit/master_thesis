* HOWTO build the network
** Preliminary step
Create these data structures from the tree
- leaves list
- father map <node_id, father node_id>
- leaves map <node_id, <child node_id, leaf node_id>>

** Uplink
- build servers, one per service
- build users using leaves list
- set users final destination as corresponding server
- aggregate users according to the fathers map
  + create an aggregator node
- put a TBF after each aggregator with ID the one of the corresponding DSLAM
- aggregate DSLAMs using the fathers map
  + create an aggregator node
- put a TBF after each aggregator with ID the one of the corresponding ROUTER
- aggregate ROUTERs using the fathers map
  + create an aggregator node
- put a TBF after each aggregator with ID the one of the MAINFRAME
- connect MAINFRAME to the servers

** Downlink
- create an aggregator node in the MAINFRAME
- connect all servers to the aggregator
- connect the aggregator to the MAINFRAME switch, using a blocking queue
- using leaves map child information, create a TBF + switch for each child node
  + assign the switch node the ID of the corresponding ROUTER
  + create a routing table <leaf, child> using the leaves map
- again using leaves map, create a TBF + switch for each child node
  + assign the child node the ID of the corresponding DSLAM
  + create a routing table using the leaves map
- connect the DSLAMs to each user using a TBF, again via the leaves map
